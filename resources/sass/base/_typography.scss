/* Set the ROOT font size; this is done in "html" selector and defines the value of 1 rem.
   We want a root font size of 10px (to make all our conversions to rems easier in the rest of our CSS),
   but we can't specify it directly as such, since that would override any DEFAULT font size
   which the user may have set (such as increasing it to compensate for declining eye-sight).
   So instead, specify the root font size as a percentage, which is a percentage of the default
   font size (whether that be browser- or user-specified).  Browsers define default font size as
   16px; our desired value of 10px is 62.5% of 16px, so set the root font size to 62.5%.  If the
   user overrides the browser's default font size, all our measurements will adjust accordingly.
